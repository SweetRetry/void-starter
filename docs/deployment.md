# Deployment

Void deploys the app to your own Cloudflare account as one Worker. Every command below runs from the repo root.

## First deploy

Pick the Worker name first: `cloudflare.name` in `apps/web/void.config.ts` (default `void-starter`). It also names the `workers.dev` subdomain.

```sh
pnpm connect
pnpm run deploy
```

Before the first answer, create the AI Gateway: Cloudflare dashboard › AI › AI Gateway › Create gateway, named `void-starter` (or the value of `AI_GATEWAY_ID`). Workers AI rejects a gateway id the account doesn't have, and the chat answers `503` saying so. One gateway serves both dev and production.

1. `pnpm connect` runs `void connect --platform cloudflare`. It signs you in to Cloudflare in the browser and records the choice in `apps/web/.void/project.json`. That file is gitignored, so each clone connects once.
2. `pnpm run deploy` runs `void deploy`. It builds the app, creates the D1 database and R2 bucket on the first run, binds Workers AI, applies pending D1 migrations and publishes the Worker. It prints the `workers.dev` URL when it's done.

`pnpm deploy` is pnpm's own command for copying a workspace package, so the script is called with `pnpm run deploy`.

On this starter's first deploy, the Worker went live with its `workers.dev` route off (Cloudflare error 1042), and later deploys failed Void's readiness check because the new version had no preview URL. If that happens, open Workers & Pages › your Worker › Settings › Domains & Routes in the dashboard, enable `workers.dev` and Preview URLs, then deploy again with your account's subdomain:

```sh
CLOUDFLARE_WORKERS_SUBDOMAIN=<your-subdomain> pnpm run deploy
```

`void.config.ts` sets `workers_dev: true`, so later deploys keep the route on.

`void deploy` writes `apps/web/void.lock.json` with your account id and the resources it created. The starter repo ignores it so no fork inherits someone else's account. In your own app, delete the `apps/web/void.lock.json` line from `.gitignore` and commit the file, so later deploys and teammates reuse the same database and bucket.

## Secrets and env

The app reads no secrets. When you add one, declare it in `apps/web/env.ts` with `defineEnv`, put the local value in `apps/web/.env`, and set the production value with `pnpm --filter web exec void secret put <NAME>`. `void secret list` shows what's set.

## AI Gateway and models

Workers AI calls name the gateway on every request (`AI_GATEWAY_ID` in `apps/web/src/server/ai.ts`, default `void-starter`). The gateway must exist first; see [First deploy](#first-deploy). Its logs, analytics, caching and rate limits live under AI › AI Gateway in the dashboard.

The model picker lists `@cf/*` models from `apps/web/src/lib/models.ts`. They need no provider key: usage counts against the account's Workers AI allowance, measured in neurons. Some models need access the account may not have; `@cf/google/gemma-3-12b-it`, for one, answered `403` ("This account is not allowed to access") on the account this starter was built with. Try a model in dev before you add it.

### Usage limits

There are no accounts, so anyone with the URL can send messages. On the Workers Free plan, Workers AI stops at the daily free allowance and the chat answers `429`. On Workers Paid, usage past the allowance is billed. Set a rate limit on the gateway (AI Gateway › Settings › Rate limiting) before you share the URL widely.

### Provider models

`ai.provider(name).fetch(path, init)` calls a provider's native API (OpenAI, Google AI Studio, or a custom provider) through the same gateway, with your own key. Store the key as a secret and declare it in `env.ts`, then set `ai: { gateway }` in `void.config.ts`:

```sh
pnpm --filter web exec void secret put OPENAI_API_KEY
```

```ts
import { ai } from "void/ai"

const response = await ai.provider("openai").fetch("/chat/completions", {
  body: { model: "gpt-4o", messages: [{ role: "user", content: prompt }] },
})
```

## Analytics

Nothing is tracked by default. For page views, turn on [Cloudflare Web Analytics](https://developers.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/) for the Worker's domain. It sets no cookies, so it needs no consent banner.

## Logs and rollback

```sh
pnpm --filter web exec void project logs       # tail the deployed Worker's logs
pnpm --filter web exec void project rollback   # return to an earlier version
```

Rollback restores code, not data. D1 migrations stay applied, so keep each migration compatible with the code before it. See [observability.md](observability.md) for traces.

## CI

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs `pnpm verify` on every push and pull request. Deploying from CI needs a Cloudflare API token; it isn't set up here.
